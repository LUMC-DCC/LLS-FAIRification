# LLS-FAIRification: Semantic modeling of the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) data.
For the Leiden Longevity Study, long-lived siblings of European descent were recruited together with their offspring and the partners of this offspring between 2002 and 2006. Families were recruited if at least two long-lived siblings were alive and fulfilled the age criterion of 89 years or older for males and 91 years or older for females. In total 944 long-lived siblings were included with a mean age of 94 years (range 89-104), 1671 offspring (61 years, 34-81) and 744 partners (60 years, 30-79). The aim of the study was to retrieve genetically determined mechanisms of longevity and their interaction with the environment. For all subjects, blood samples and other biomaterial was taken, and demography information, information on medical history and self-reported / survey information was collected. Data are stored at LUMC data warehouse OPAL and are made human-findable through [data catalogue Mica](https://dw.clinicalresearch.nl/pub/study/lls).

In this Github repository we present a complementary effort to semantically model the LSS data. It is a preliminary effort to make Dutch cohort data interoperable according to the FAIR principles as well. The presented models:
* Are still in an early developmental stage
* Are based on the semantic model of common data elements for rare disease registries (see [here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-022-00264-6) and [here](https://github.com/ejp-rd-vp/CDE-semantic-model))
* Make use of [OBO foundry ontologies](https://obofoundry.org/) were possible
* Are limited to demography data for now
